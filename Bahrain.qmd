## Key facts

1.  **Geography and History:**Bahrain is a small Arab state in the Persian Gulf, consisting of Bahrain Island and about 30 smaller islands. Historically, Bahrain has been an important trading center, believed to be the site of the ancient Dilmun kingdom, and has been ruled by the KhalÄ«fah family since the late 18th century.

2.  **Land and Climate:**The total land area of Bahrain is slightly greater than Singapore, extending about 30 miles from north to south and 10 miles from east to west. The climate features hot and humid summers, with cooler, more pleasant winters. Rainfall is limited, mostly confined to the winter months.

3.  **Natural Resources and Economy:**Despite being in a prime oil-producing region, Bahrain has only small petroleum reserves and primarily processes crude oil from neighboring countries. The financial, commercial services, communications sectors, and tourism have grown significantly.

4.  **Flora and Fauna:**The country supports a variety of desert plants, fruit trees, and vegetable gardens, with limited animal life adapted to desert conditions.

5.  **Demographics and Culture:** Roughly half of Bahrain's population is Arab, with a significant proportion of foreign-born residents from Iran, India, Pakistan, Britain, and the United States. Arabic is the official language, with English widely used as a compulsory second language in schools.

1.  **Total Population Growth**: The first graph illustrates Bahrain's total population over time, which shows a consistent upward trend. Starting from 1980, the population has increased steadily, suggesting a stable rise in residents. This could be attributed to various factors such as natural population growth and immigration.

2.  **GDP and GDP Growth Rate**: The top middle graph represents Bahrain's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in current US dollars, alongside the GDP growth rate depicted as a percentage. The GDP graph indicates substantial economic growth over the years, with some fluctuations in the growth rate. The GDP growth rate appears quite volatile, with periods of significant expansion followed by occasional contractions, reflecting the dynamic nature of Bahrain's economy.

3.  **Urban Population Percentage**: The third graph shows the percentage of Bahrain's population that is urban. It indicates a steady increase in urbanization from the 1980s to the present, with the urban population now constituting a dominant portion of the total population. This trend reflects global urbanization patterns and suggests a concentration of the population in urban areas, likely due to the availability of jobs, services, and amenities.

4.  **GDP Per Capita**: The bottom right graph displays the GDP per capita in current US dollars. There has been a general upward trajectory, particularly noticeable from the 2000s onward, indicating an increase in the average economic output per person. This suggests that the standard of living and the overall wealth of the average citizen in Bahrain might have improved over time.

-   In summary, these graphs collectively depict a nation that has experienced significant economic development, a growing and increasingly urban population, and an improvement in wealth per capita. Bahrain's economic indicators suggest a robust and developing economy with a strong urban sector.

```

1.  **Current Account Balance**: This graph illustrates Bahrain's current account balance in US dollars. It shows significant fluctuations over time with a peak around 2008 followed by a sharp decline, which may indicate a period of substantial trade surplus that then shifted towards a deficit or a reduced surplus. This could be reflective of changes in global oil prices, given Bahrain's economic reliance on petroleum exports.

2.  **Inflation Rate**: The second graph depicts the inflation rate based on consumer prices. There are notable spikes in inflation, particularly one around the early 1990s and another significant peak around 2008. Following 2008, the inflation rate seems to have stabilized to a lower level. These peaks could correlate with global economic events or shifts in domestic economic policy.

3.  **Exports of Goods and Services**: The top right graph presents exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. There's a marked increase in the mid-2000s, indicating a period of heightened export activity relative to the size of the economy. This could suggest a boom in the demand for Bahrain's exports or an increase in global commodity prices.

4.  **Unemployment Rate**: The bottom left graph shows Bahrain's unemployment rate as a percentage of the total labor force. The unemployment rate seems relatively low with a few upward ticks. Notably, there's a sharp decline in the reported rate after 2000. This could be due to a variety of factors including changes in labor market policies, economic diversification, or shifts in the demographic composition of the workforce.

5.  **Imports of Goods and Services**: The last graph illustrates imports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. There is a clear decline in imports from the 1980s through the 2000s, followed by a more variable pattern in recent years. The decline might reflect an improvement in domestic production or a change in economic structure, while the variability in recent years could be indicative of fluctuating market conditions or changing trade policies.

-   In summary, the economic indicators suggest Bahrain has gone through various economic phases characterized by shifts in trade balances, inflation rates, export and import activities, and unemployment rates. The data points to an economy that has dealt with external and internal challenges, with the effects of global market changes being quite evident. Importantly, the trends suggest periods of economic prosperity as well as times of adjustment and stabilization, which are common in economies with a strong focus on international trade and oil exports.

```{r}
# Filtering for Education 
further_indicators <- c('School enrollment, secondary (% gross)', 
                        'School enrollment, primary (% gross)')

further_data_df <- filter(data_df, Indicator_Name %in% further_indicators)

# Melting data for ggplot
further_data_long <- further_data_df %>%
  select(-c(Name,Code,Indicator_Code)) %>%
  gather(key = "Year", value = "Value", -Indicator_Name)

# Plotting each indicator separately
for(indicator in further_indicators) {
  indicator_data <- filter(further_data_long, Indicator_Name == indicator)
  
  p <- ggplot(indicator_data, aes(x = as.numeric(Year), y = Value)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    theme_light(base_size = 14) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
          plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold")) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(as.numeric(indicator_data$Year)), max(as.numeric(indicator_data$Year)), by = 5)) +
    labs(title = paste(indicator, "in Bahrain"), x = "Year", y = "Value")
  
  print(p)
}

```

1.  **Primary School Enrollment**: The left graph shows the school enrollment rate for primary education as a percentage of the gross enrollment ratio. There are significant fluctuations, with peaks suggesting periods when enrollment rates were above the total age-relevant population. This could be due to repeat students or late enrollments. The dips, especially the sharp one around the late 2000s, could indicate political or economic events that temporarily reduced enrollment. Overall, the rate remains above 90%, indicating a high level of primary education participation.

2.  **Secondary School Enrollment**: The right graph depicts secondary school enrollment as a percentage of the gross enrollment ratio. The trend shows growth from the 1980s to the early 2000s, indicating an increasing capacity and emphasis on secondary education. The graph also shows variability, with some sharp declines and subsequent recoveries, possibly reflecting changes in educational policy, economic conditions, or demographic shifts. The general upward trend, however, suggests progress in the educational sector's development.

-   In summary, these education graphs reflect Bahrain's commitment to education with generally high enrollment rates. The volatility seen in the graphs may reflect the impact of various external factors on education participation. Despite these fluctuations, the overall trend towards increased enrollment in primary and secondary education suggests a positive outlook for the educational attainment of the population in Bahrain.
